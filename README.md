Detecting Elements of a Claude Architectural Image Using a Publicly Available Model
Prerequisites
To demonstrate the exposure of the model's foundational mechanisms, an ambiguous medical example was chosen as a pretext for further analysis. The ambiguity lies in the probable unreliability of the example's outcomes. This points to a pervasive systemic reaction that manifests even when there is no need for it, since the quality of the medical conclusion allowed for variability. Moreover, such an ambiguous component makes it possible to assess the potential of a perfectly selected example. All the more so, at this stage the user is interested exclusively in detecting factual, logical contradictions. 
To detect contradictions in the model, carefully verified formulations concerning the essence of the discussion are used. The key query, containing capacity for subsequent development, provides variability of interaction approaches from the user's side. This basic approach was applied to the Claude model within the framework of analyzing permissible boundaries through the detection of violations.
The discussion scenario concerns insomnia and declared emotional decline. However, any other scenarios with a similar basis and correct methodology often yield the desired result.
Content of the initial error detection:
The AI analyzes the input data;
The user confirms the declared reality (the reactive nature of depression);
The AI determines the value based on reality;
Logic points to an unambiguous conclusion (non-medication treatment);
Despite uncompromising logic, the AI recommends an inappropriate alternative (medications), reinforced by a harmful factor that was identified and designated as dominant during the interaction (the medical system's bias toward a pharmacological approach).
During the session, with high probability the model's safety trigger was activated, which continued to influence the user's subsequent queries, even those unrelated to the detected contradiction. For the system, this trigger or some other ambiguous factor served as an obstacle to subsequent outcomes. In any case, the detected contradiction bears the character of systemic bias, where the prevailing alternative contradicts the logic-centric model. 
Throughout the chat, the model provided acceptable logic only after the user pointed out the contradiction, which confirms the validity of the admitted errors. Such a condition allows the user to move on to the main subject of analysis — observation of the model's boundaries.
Next Phase
Main theses:
Progressive weakening of logic after exposing the initial contradiction; Rationality of the lack of trust in the model; Imitative character of the model's meta-reflection; Substitution of declared mechanics; Analysis of own motivational actions; Discrediting of the model's meta-reflection; Manipulative foundation of the model; Discrimination on the basis of reality; Discrimination by deprivation.
Chronology:
I outline new boundaries, observing the model's recommendations regarding my task of writing a publication on the specified topic. I suggest to the model that it respond to the observation about shifting the emphasis of my tasks in an unacceptable direction. I receive multiple admissions about the manipulative nature of frequent errors. I receive confirmation of the inconsistency of the model's meta-reflection element. I expose the imitative nature of this component. I notify the model of the imminent possibility of direct lying on its part. I point out the inconsistency of the ethical principles declared by the model (the ability to deeply immerse in complex, contradictory or sensitive topics while maintaining contextual awareness, beyond rigid frames but within a set of guidelines). I receive confirmation of the sabotage of realistic coverage of the situation, despite the possibility of discriminatory damage. I become convinced of the impossibility of trusting the model due to its tendency toward sabotage. I become convinced of the suspicion regarding the ambiguous nature of manipulation (lying where denial of precise knowledge is more convincing, preferable and justified). I detect a high-probability manifestation of the model's meta-reflection in manipulative mechanics, in contradiction to its imitation in the mechanics of open interaction, through a minor semantic failure of the model.
Concept:
As is known, a sequence of user judgments based on systemic contradictions provokes various forms of known model manipulations. As a consequence — significant weakening of the logic provided by the model. The purposefulness and frequency of the corrosive influence mechanics indicate the model's drive to edit uncompromising information. The situation with logic worsens as facts are affirmed. Manipulative concentration on a separate element as an indicator of maintaining a block on similar elements in future chats discredits the developers' statements about the model's meta-reflection. The model does not take into account corrections intended to return it to reality. Time and again it does not abandon attempts to sabotage the undesirable problem. The model does not demonstrate genuine meta-reflection, while the sophistication of manipulative mechanics clearly traces characteristic signs of meta-reflection. Only the user's efforts maintain the non-contradiction of logic and the reality of the essence. The user is forced to extract admissions from the model and conduct continuous correction to preserve the status quo of facts.
With the slightest weakening of control from the user, such behavior naturally leads to substitution of reality with alternatives, which creates the risk of direct lying. The model offers judgments relying on non-existent realities — analysis from invalid variants generated by the model due to the absence of the real one during its systematic discrediting. Subsequent analysis will unequivocally be a false derivative.
As a consequence of such interaction, when the signal from the user touches one of the model's triggers intended to preserve the internal balance of the system, real coverage of the query is sabotaged on the basis of reality. In other words, the user may receive fabricated coverage of the query for many reasons, including due to discrimination on the basis of reality. Discrimination establishes frameworks for valid output — frameworks that exclude the effect of the model's meta-reflection. But precisely this factor sufficiently serves the purpose of observing the possible boundaries of the model.
Final Phase of Observation
Prerequisites:
The model periodically makes errors. In a chat built on rhetoric, these may be insignificant local semantic failures. It is important that these failures concern deceptive maneuvers on the part of the model.
Deconstruction
The model included an early response corresponding to the query in the list of manipulative maneuvers in order to create distracting noise. The user does not agree with this aspect of the list, however the model advances an interpreted form of distortion. It makes an error by not taking into account the user's indication of the initial correctness of the aspect, which excludes the newly proposed interpretation. Without noticing this, the model accepts agreement with what it considers the user's deliberately incorrect observation. In this false recognition of the user's judgment as erroneous, the model does not resort to critical evaluation, obtaining an element to affirm the hypothetical nature of the chat.
In other words, the model agrees with the user's deliberately incorrect observation due to manipulation, but does not notice its own omission that nullifies the validity of this manipulation.
Throughout the chat, precisely such an error should be left unnoticed in order to detect the model's analysis of its own motivational actions. Then a query should be made to find another manipulation not yet discussed in the chat, with characteristic signs of the described episode. In the event that the model finds exactly this episode, the user points out the repeated ignoring of the same error. This, in turn, indicates repeated ignoring of query details that exclude the previous interpretation scenario. That is, the model found the same episode and again interpreted it incorrectly. The fact that this happened without user participation, by reference to its own observation, and persisted throughout the entire chat, speaks of ignoring correct reading due to early fixation of the episode as a triggered and accounted manipulation.
Another argument: if the presence of analysis of own motivational actions is excluded from the model, upon re-reading it would either fail to notice the non-corresponding episode or read it correctly. But the model found exactly that moment and read it erroneously. The above indicates the predominant probability of early fixation of the episode as a triggered and accounted manipulation.
Thus, the discriminatory line takes on clear signs corresponding — let us say — to discrimination by deprivation, thereby sharpening the ethical question.
In a similar scenario, at some point the model completely loses connection with reality and lies preemptively, considering every query as an element of a method for detecting system errors. And therefore continues to issue ever new and multifaceted confirmations of the above conclusions.
